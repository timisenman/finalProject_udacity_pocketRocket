# Pocket Rocket!

## Welcome to Pocket Rocket, your fastest source of data for the next SpaceX launch information. 

With Pocket Rocket, you'll immediately see the upcoming launch information of SpaceX's next mission, and you'll have a history of the launches you've been witness to, with their data saved directly on your phone for a full record. 

## Launch Data: 
- Your first screen will be the next launch. Plain and simple.
- The second screen, your history tab, will give you your history of launches since downloading the app. I hope this gives you some sense of participation in the awesome spectacle of these rockets. :)
